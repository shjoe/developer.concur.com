Thank you for your interest in an App Center Partnership to develop an ERP integration between SAP Concur’s products and your chosen ERP brand. The App Center Certification Program requires each desired ERP Brand to be certified. The certified application must support the Expense & Invoice products for both of SAP Concur’s Editions (Standard + Professional Edition). Unless noted as _Optional_ all portions are required.

## <a name="learn"></a>Learn

Use the following resources to get familiar with the SAP Concur product and then submit expense reports or invoices in your own sandbox. This will better position you to conduct end-to-end testing and be able to correlate a User's experience to what you obtain via the APIs.

* **Shared Technical Services Videos** at [http://www.concurtraining.com/prdeployment/sts](http://www.concurtraining.com/prdeployment/sts) - The videos found here will help you understand the unique types of transactions that can occur in the Expense product and their resulting impacts on the financial picture in the extract file.

## <a name="phases"></a>Phased Development Approaches

There is a likelihood the ERP integration components will need to be certified in a phased approach. If necessary, the phases are to be completed as specified below. Standard and Professional Editions must be supported with each phase. You cannot go to production with support for only one of the edition types since you will not know which edition type customers will use. The phases are to be done in this sequence and must include:

Phase 1|Phase 2
---|---
Quick Connect|Manage lists of Cost Object codes
Company Profile|Add and update Vendor data
Financial posting via Financial Integration Service|Send Purchase Order data to SAP Concur
-|Send Purchase Order Receipt data to SAP Concur

### <a name="quick-connect"></a>Quick Connect

**Quick Connect** describes the process customers use to connect their SAP Concur site with an App Center Partner's Enterprise application. See the separate Quick Connect scope document for details to guide you through the development of this required piece to your certified application.

[Quick Connect Scope for Enterprise Apps](./quick-connect-scope-for-enterprise-apps.html)

If you're already familiar with Quick Connect and just need information about Authorization, see [Authentication - Enterprise Business Applications](/api-reference/authentication/apidoc.html#enterprise-business-applications).

### <a name="profile"></a>Company Profile

This API provides the partner with 2 key pieces of information:

*  Company `UUID` - Partner will record this value per customer connection and use it when submitting Support cases.
*  `MarketingName` data element - Partner will record this value per customer. This will indicate the edition type a customer is using:
  * `CTE` or `Enterprise` means the customer is using Professional Edition.
  * `Standard` means the customer is using Standard Edition.

### <a name="integration-manage-lists"></a>Manage lists of Cost Object codes

[List Item v3 API](/api-reference/common/list-item/v3.list-item.html)

The integration is different depending on Expense or Invoice:

* **Invoice**: **Required** Use of the List API is required for the Invoice integration (e.g. for the custom list values that are part of the Vendor Master records).

* **Expense**: _Optional_ Use of the List API is not required for the Expense integration at this time.

The List API should be executed in an asynchronous manner. Here are two documents that illustrates asynchronous execution:

* [https://spring.io/guides/gs/async-method/](https://spring.io/guides/gs/async-method/)
* [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/)
